# Product Guidelines: NoApp

## Visual Identity
- **Color Palette:** 
    - **Base:** Soft neutrals (creamy whites, light greys, and muted charcoals) to minimize eye strain and evoke a "papery" feel.
    - **Modes:** Support for a manually toggled Light and Dark mode, with an option to sync with system preferences.
- **Typography:** 
    - **Headings:** Elegant serif fonts for titles to mimic printed documents.
    - **Body:** Clean, legible sans-serif for content to ensure clarity during long writing sessions.
- **Texture & Spacing:** Subtle use of borders and soft shadows to define boundaries; priority on generous whitespace to maintain a calm atmosphere.

## Interaction Patterns
- **Motion:** Utilize subtle, fluid transitions and gentle fades. Avoid jarring animations to keep the user focused.
- **Tactile Feedback:** Visual cues should feel organic and soft, reinforcing the "paper and ink" metaphor.
- **Safety Nets:** 
    - **Deletion:** A multi-layered approach including a local "Trash" folder, confirmation prompts for permanent deletion, and "Undo" snackbars for immediate mistakes.

## Specialized Views
- **Focus Mode:** A full-screen, immersive experience that strips away all navigation, sidebars, and UI chrome, leaving only the primary task or note area visible.
